# job-portal
Job Portal is a full-stack web application built with React.js (frontend), Spring Boot (backend), and PostgreSQL (database). It enables job seekers to search and apply for jobs while allowing admins to post, edit, and manage list. The system includes role-based access, applicant tracking with resume uploads, and advanced search by skills.
